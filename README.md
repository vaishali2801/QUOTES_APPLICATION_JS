JavaScript Quotes Slider – Practice Project

This folder contains my JavaScript Quotes Slider project, created to practice DOM manipulation, array handling, timers, and event-based logic in JavaScript.
The project focuses on building a fully functional, responsive quotes slider that displays inspirational quotes with background images using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

📘 What This Project Covers

This quotes slider project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

JavaScript arrays for storing quotes, images, and author names

Object-based data handling

Index-based navigation logic

DOM selection and dynamic content updates

Event handling using button clicks

Timer functions (setInterval, clearInterval)

Conditional logic for looping quotes

Responsive UI styling

📂 What This Folder Includes

Each file in this folder plays a specific role in the quotes slider functionality:

#HTML file

Structure of the quotes slider

Image container for background images

Quote text and author display section

Previous and Next navigation buttons

#CSS file

Full-screen background image styling

Glassmorphism quote box design

Smooth fade animations and transitions

Button positioning with hover effects

Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop

#JavaScript file

Array of quote objects (image, quote text, author)

Index tracking for the current slide

showSlide() function for dynamic updates

prevClick() and nextClick() navigation logic

Auto-play functionality using timers

Reset logic on manual navigation

📌 Each file is kept simple, readable, and well-structured to clearly understand the flow of the quotes slider logic.

🔧 Core Functionality

The quotes slider works on the following logic:

Quotes, images, and authors are stored as objects inside an array

An index variable tracks the currently active quote

Clicking Next increases the index

Clicking Previous decreases the index

When the last quote is reached, the slider loops back to the first

When navigating before the first quote, it jumps to the last

Auto-play changes quotes at a fixed time interval

Manual navigation resets the auto-play timer

This ensures smooth, infinite, and user-friendly quote navigation.

🎯 Goal of This Quotes Slider Project

Understand real-world usage of arrays and objects

Practice DOM manipulation with dynamic text and images

Improve event handling and timer control in JavaScript

Build confidence in writing logic-driven UI components

Create reusable quote slider logic for future projects

🌱 Learning Outcome

This project helped me connect logic and UI together, making JavaScript more practical, interactive, and meaningful.
It enhanced my understanding of how modern sliders work behind the scenes and strengthened my ability to build interactive frontend components.

This quotes slider is not just a project — it’s my hands-on practice ground to experiment, debug, and grow as a JavaScript developer.
